## Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

- **Lead with value**: Start with what the project accomplishes, not how it works
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use visuals to demonstrate capabilities
- **Quantify everything**: Use specific numbers, percentages, and metrics
- **Target your audience**: Write for potential employers, clients, or collaborators
- **Keep it scannable**: Use headers, bullet points, and white space effectively
- **Test the experience**: Have someone else review and test all links
